### Personal information you disclose to me

_**In Short:** I collect personal information that you provide to me._

I collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to me when you express an interest in obtaining information about me or my products and Services, when you participate in activities on the Services, or otherwise when you contact me.

**Personal Information Provided by You.** The personal information that I collect depends on the context of your interactions with me and the Services, the choices you make, and the products and features you use. The personal information I collect may include the following:

### Information automatically collected

_**In Short:** Some information — such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and/or browser and device characteristics — is collected automatically when you visit my Services._

I automatically collect certain information when you visit, use, or navigate the Services. This information does not reveal your specific identity (like your name or contact information) but may include device and usage information, such as your IP address, browser and device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, device name, country, location, information about how and when you use my Services, and other technical information. This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of my Services, and for my internal analytics and reporting purposes.

Like many businesses, I also collect information through cookies and similar technologies.

The information I collect includes:

* _Log and Usage Data._ Log and usage data is service-related, diagnostic, usage, and performance information my servers automatically collect when you access or use my Services and which I record in log files. Depending on how you interact with me, this log data may include your IP address, device information, browser type, and settings and information about your activity in the Services (such as the date/time stamps associated with your usage, pages and files viewed, searches, and other actions you take such as which features you use), device event information (such as system activity, error reports (sometimes called "crash dumps"), and hardware settings).
* _Device Data._ I collect device data such as information about your computer, phone, tablet, or other device you use to access the Services. Depending on the device used, this device data may include information such as your IP address (or proxy server), device and application identification numbers, location, browser type, hardware model, Internet service provider and/or mobile carrier, operating system, and system configuration information.
* _Location Data._ I collect location data such as information about your device's location, which can be either precise or imprecise. How much information I collect depends on the type and settings of the device you use to access the Services. For example, I may use GPS and other technologies to collect geolocation data that tells me your current location (based on your IP address). You can opt out of allowing me to collect this information either by refusing access to the information or by disabling your Location setting on your device. However, if you choose to opt out, you may not be able to use certain aspects of the Services.

## 2. How do I process your information?

_**In Short:** I process your information to provide, improve, and administer my Services, communicate with you, for security and fraud prevention, and to comply with law. I may also process your information for other purposes with your consent._

## 3. What legal bases do I rely on to process your information?

_**In Short:** I only process your personal information when I believe it is necessary and I have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill my contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill my legitimate business interests._

### Users in the European Union and United Kingdom

_If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you._

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require me to explain the valid legal bases I rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, I may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:

* **Consent.** I may process your information if you have given me permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Learn more about [withdrawing your consent](privacy-policy.md#withdrawing-your-consent).
* **Performance of a Contract.** I may process your personal information when I believe it is necessary to fulfill my contractual obligations to you, including providing my Services or at your request prior to entering into a contract with you.
* **Legitimate Interests.** I may process your information when I believe it is reasonably necessary to achieve my legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, I may process your personal information for some of the purposes described in order to:

* **Vital Interests.** I may process your information where I believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.

### Users in Canada

_If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you._

I may process your information if you have given me specific permission (i.e., express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent). You can [withdraw your consent](privacy-policy.md#withdrawing-your-consent) at any time.

In some exceptional cases, I may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:

* If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way
* For investigations and fraud detection and prevention
* For business transactions provided certain conditions are met
* If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim
* For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin
* If I have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse
* If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province
* If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records
* If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced
* If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes
* If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations

## 4. When and with whom do I share your information?

_**In Short:** I may share information in specific situations described in this section and/or with the following third parties._

I may need to share your personal information in the following situations:

* **Business Transfers.** I may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of my business to another company.
* **When I use Google Maps Platform APIs.** I may share your information with certain Google Maps Platform APIs (e.g., Google Maps API, Places API). I obtain and store on your device ("cache") your location. You may revoke your consent anytime by contacting me at the contact details provided at the end of this document.

## 5. Do I use cookies and other tracking technologies?

_**In Short:** I may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your information._

I may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to access or store information. Specific information about how I use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in my [Cookie Notice](cookie-policy.md).

## 6. How long do I keep your information?

_**In Short:** I keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law._

I will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements).

When I have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, I will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then I will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

## 7. How do I keep your information safe?

_**In Short:** I aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures._

I have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information I process. However, despite my safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so I cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cyber criminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat my security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although I will do my best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from my Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.

## 8. Do I collect information from minors?

_**In Short:** I do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age._

I do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Services. If I learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, I will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from my records. If you become aware of any data I may have collected from children under age 18, please contact me at [legal@thiboverbeerst.com](mailto:legal@thiboverbeerst.com).

## 9. What are your privacy rights?

_**In Short:** In some regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), Switzerland, and Canada, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time._

In some regions (like the EEA, UK, Switzerland, and Canada), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; (iv) if applicable, to data portability; and (v) not to be subject to automated decision-making. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. You can make such a request by contacting me by using the contact details provided in the section "[How can you contact me about this notice?](privacy-policy.md#13.-how-can-you-contact-me-about-this-notice)" below.

I will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.

If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe I am unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your [Member State data protection authority](https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index\_en.htm) or [UK data protection authority](https://ico.org.uk/make-a-complaint/data-protection-complaints/data-protection-complaints/).

If you are located in Switzerland, you may contact the [Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner](https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html).

### Withdrawing your consent

If I am relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting me by using the contact details provided in the section "[How can you contact me about this notice?](privacy-policy.md#13.-how-can-you-contact-me-about-this-notice)" below.

However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.

### Opting out of marketing and promotional communications

You can unsubscribe from my marketing and promotional communications at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the emails that I send, or by contacting me using the details provided in the section "[How can you contact me about this notice?](privacy-policy.md#13.-how-can-you-contact-me-about-this-notice)" below. You will then be removed from the marketing lists. However, I may still communicate with you — for example, to send you service-related messages that are necessary for the administration and use of your account, to respond to service requests, or for other non-marketing purposes.&#x20;

### Cookies and similar technologies

Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of my Services.

If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email me at [legal@thiboverbeerst.com](mailto:legal@thiboverbeerst.com).

## 10. Controls for do-not -track features

Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, I do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that I must follow in the future, I will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.

Upon receiving your request, I will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person about whom I have the information in my system.

For instance, depending on the type of request you submit, I may ask you to provide certain information so that I can match the information you provide with the information I already have on file, or I may contact you through a communication method (e.g., phone or email) that you have previously provided to me. I may also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.

I will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent possible, I will avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes of verification. However, if I cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained by me, I may request that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity and for security or fraud-prevention purposes.
