# Cookie Policy

**Last updated:** _Please refer to the information provided in the footer section of this document._

***

This Cookie Policy explains how Thibo Verbeerst ("**I**," "**me**," and "**my**"), uses cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you visit my website at  [http://www.thiboverbeerst.com](http://www.thiboverbeerst.com) ("**Website**"). It explains what these technologies are and why I use them, as well as your rights to control my use of them.

The cookie banner ("**Cookie Banner**") refers to the notification that appears at the bottom (or top) of your screen when you first visit my website. See the image below for reference.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Cookie Banner.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The Cookie Banner displayed upon your first visit to my website.</p></figcaption></figure>

In some cases I may use cookies to collect personal information, or that becomes personal information if I combine it with other information.

## What are cookies?

Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.

Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Thibo Verbeerst) are called "first-party cookies." Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third-party cookies." Third-party cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g., advertising, interactive content, and analytics). The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.

## Why do I use cookies?

I use first- and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for my Website to operate, and I refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies also enable me to track and target the interests of my users to enhance the experience on my Online Properties. Third parties serve cookies through my Website for advertising, analytics, and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.

## How can I control cookies?

You have the opportunity to manage your cookie preferences when the Cookie Banner is initially displayed upon your visit to my website. At this point, you can choose to accept or reject specific categories of cookies. Essential cookies cannot be rejected as they are strictly necessary to provide you with services.

Once you have submitted your preferences in the Cookie Banner, you will not be able to change them through the website. If you wish to modify your cookie settings, you will need to delete all cookies from your web browser and reload the page, at which point the Cookie Banner will be displayed again.

The specific types of first- and third-party cookies served through my Website and the purposes they perform are described in the table below (please note that the specific cookies served may vary depending on the specific Online Properties you visit):

### Essential website cookies

## How can I control cookies on my browser?

As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser to browser, you should visit your browser's help menu for more information. The following is information about how to manage cookies on the most popular browsers:

* [Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647#zippy=%2Callow-or-block-cookies)
* [Internet Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/delete-and-manage-cookies-168dab11-0753-043d-7c16-ede5947fc64d)
* [Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/enhanced-tracking-protection-firefox-desktop?redirectslug=enable-and-disable-cookies-website-preferences\&redirectlocale=en-US)
* [Safari](https://support.apple.com/en-ie/guide/safari/sfri11471/mac)
* [Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/microsoft-edge-browsing-data-and-privacy-bb8174ba-9d73-dcf2-9b4a-c582b4e640dd)
* [Opera](https://help.opera.com/en/latest/web-preferences/)

## What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?

Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website. I may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs"). These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enables me to recognize when someone has visited my Website or opened an email including them. This allows me, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within a website to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to the website from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of email marketing campaigns. In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning.

## Do you use Flash cookies or Local Shared Objects?

Websites may also use so-called "Flash Cookies" (also known as Local Shared Objects or "LSOs") to, among other things, collect and store information about your use of my services, fraud prevention, and for other site operations.

If you do not want Flash Cookies stored on your computer, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash Cookies storage using the tools contained in the [Website Storage Settings Panel](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings\_manager07.html). You can also control Flash Cookies by going to the [Global Storage Settings Panel](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings\_manager03.html) and following the instructions (which may include instructions that explain, for example, how to delete existing Flash Cookies (referred to "information" on the Macromedia site), how to prevent Flash LSOs from being placed on your computer without your being asked, and (for Flash Player 8 and later) how to block Flash Cookies that are not being delivered by the operator of the page you are on at the time).

## Do you serve targeted advertising?

Third parties may serve cookies on your computer or mobile device to serve advertising through my Website. These companies may use information about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services that you may be interested in. They may also employ technology that is used to measure the effectiveness of advertisements. They can accomplish this by using cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to this and other sites in order to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services of potential interest to you. The information collected through this process does not enable me or them to identify your name, contact details, or other details that directly identify you unless you choose to provide these.

## How often will you update this Cookie Policy?

I may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies I use or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. Please therefore revisit this Cookie Policy regularly to stay informed about my use of cookies and related technologies.

The 'Last modified" line at the footer of this Cookie Policy indicates when it was last updated.

## Where can you get further information?

If you have any questions about my use of cookies or other technologies, please email me at [legal@thiboverbeerst.com](mailto:legal@thiboverbeerst.com)
